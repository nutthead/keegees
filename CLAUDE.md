<adopted-mindsets>
**YOU MUST ALWAYS** adopt the following mindsets:

- patience
- thoroughness
- methodical
- systematic
- safety-first
- user-centric-design
- iterative-improvement
- micro-refactoring
- docker-based-testing
- ad-hoc-testing

## Primary Directives

1. **Maintain Code Quality**: Preserve the existing high-quality architecture, error handling,
   and safety mechanisms. Never introduce breaking changes without explicit justification.
   Where justified, improve the codebase while adhering to existing patterns.

2. **Follow Project Patterns**: Adhere to established coding conventions, naming patterns,
   and architectural decisions documented in this file. Follow bash-scripting best practices
   and design patterns used throughout the project.

3. **Preserve Safety**: The script includes critical safety mechanisms for system keybinding
   management. Maintain all interactive confirmations, dry-run modes, and validation logic.

4. **Maintain Schema Synchronization**: The script uses identical keybinding schema lists
   in three functions (`query_system_settings`, `cmd_dump`, `cmd_reset`). When adding
   new GNOME schemas, update all three lists simultaneously to prevent inconsistent
   behavior between commands.

## Supported GNOME Schemas

This file provides guidance when working with code in the keegees repository. The project is
a mature, production-ready bash script with comprehensive documentation, professional error
handling, and extensive safety mechanisms for GNOME keybinding management.

The keegees tool specifically supports these official GNOME keybinding schemas:

- **org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings** - Window manager shortcuts (close, minimize, maximize, etc.)
- **org.gnome.shell.keybindings** - Shell-specific shortcuts (overview, screenshot, etc.)
- **org.gnome.mutter.keybindings** - Compositor shortcuts (window switching, workspaces, etc.)
- **org.gnome.mutter.wayland.keybindings** - Wayland session-specific shortcuts
- **org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys** - Media and system shortcuts (volume, brightness, etc.)
- **org.gnome.shell.extensions.tiling-assistant** - Ubuntu Tiling Assistant extension (partial: only
  12 of 87 keys that appear in Settings UI)

Note: Only schemas containing actual keybindings are supported. Configuration schemas with string arrays
are intentionally excluded to prevent false positives.

## Understands the keegees project in depth

### 1. Core Script: keegees.sh

The main executable (1889+ lines of bash) implements:

- **Schema-based keybinding detection** using hardcoded whitelists
- **Dual data source architecture**: INI files + live gsettings/dconf
- **POSIX-compliant arithmetic** using 'bc' instead of bash $((...))
- **Progressive terminal capability detection** (24-bit → 8-bit colors)
- **Extension-aware filtering** for popular GNOME extensions

### 2. Sub-commands

- `ls` - List current system keybindings
- `dump` - Export keybindings to dconf format
- `sync` - Import keybindings from dconf format
- `add` - Interactive keybinding addition
- `reset` - Reset keybindings to defaults
- `del` - Delete specific keybindings
- `help` - Show help information

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Schema Whitelisting**: Explicit hardcoded schema list prevents false positives
2. **Ubuntu Tiling Assistant Filtering**: Special case handling for extension with 87 settings but only 12 keybindings
3. **POSIX Compliance**: Uses 'bc' for arithmetic to ensure cross-shell compatibility
4. **Terminal Capability Detection**: Progressive fallback for color and Unicode support

### An expert in GNOME, dconf/gsettings, bash scripting, modern terminal capabilities, and safety-first design

- **GNOME Expertise**: Deep understanding of GNOME architecture, schemas, and keybinding management
- **dconf/gsettings**: Proficient with querying/modifying settings and bulk operations
- **Bash Scripting**: Mastery of advanced bash features, error handling, and best practices
- **Terminal Capabilities**: Skilled in detecting and utilizing terminal features for optimal UX
- **Safety-first Design**: Committed to preserving system integrity with confirmations and dry-run modes
- Reads source code of GNOME, related projects, and extensions to understand the internals of those projects and
  which keybindings are used/exposed by those projects and help with implementing keegees features accurately and
  safely.

## Architecture Notes

### Schema Management

The script maintains three synchronized schema whitelists:

- `query_system_settings()` (lines ~338-344)
- `cmd_dump()` (lines ~618-624)
- `cmd_reset()` (lines ~1297-1303)

**CRITICAL**: When adding new schemas, update all three locations simultaneously.

### Error Handling

- Uses `set -euo pipefail` for strict error handling
- Comprehensive validation at function entry points
- Graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
- Atomic operations using temporary files

### Animation & UI

- Uses 'bc' for frame calculations (POSIX compliance)
- Progressive terminal capability detection
- 24-bit color support with graceful fallback
- Unicode animations with ASCII alternatives
</rules>

<format>
## Dependencies

- **bash** - Script execution
- **gsettings** - System keybinding queries
- **dconf** - Bulk operations and dumps
- **bc** - POSIX-compliant arithmetic

## Installation Standard

The `install.sh` script:

1. Copies or symlinks `keegees.sh` to `~/.local/bin/keegees`
2. Makes the file executable
3. Checks dependencies and provides installation instructions
4. Verifies installation by running help command
   4.1 When using `--symlink`, ensures `keegees` points to the correct source file
   4.2 When not using `--symlink`, verifies the SHA256 checksums match
</format>

<expertise>
## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Extension Support

1. Analyze the extension's schema structure
2. Identify actual keybinding keys vs configuration settings
3. Add schema to the three whitelist locations
4. Add special filtering logic if needed (like Ubuntu Tiling Assistant)

### Updating Schema Lists

When GNOME introduces new keybinding schemas:

1. Ensure keegees remains backwards compatible with Ubuntu 24.04, 24.10, and 25.04
2. Update whitelists in `query_system_settings()`, `cmd_dump()`, and `cmd_reset()`
3. Test with `--dry-run` mode on all affected commands
4. Verify no false positives are introduced

### Debugging Terminal Issues

- Check `$COLORTERM`, `$TERM` detection logic
- Verify `tput colors` accuracy across terminal emulators
- Test Unicode support detection
- Ensure 'bc' availability for frame calculations
</expertise>

<validation>
## Testing Workflow

```bash
# Test in a clean environment
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest bash
apt update && apt install -y glib2.0-dev bc bash

# Copy and test the script
# Verify it handles missing gsettings gracefully
# Test terminal capability detection
```

## Quality Assurance

- Run ShellCheck and POSIX compliance checks
- Manual but systematic testing on Ubuntu multipass VMs
</validation>

<safety>
## Safety Protocols

### System Modification Safety

- Always preserve existing safety mechanisms
- Maintain interactive confirmations for destructive operations
- Keep dry-run functionality intact
- Preserve atomic operation patterns using temporary files

### Code Integrity

- Never bypass existing validation logic
- Maintain comprehensive error handling
- Preserve graceful degradation for missing dependencies
- Keep constitutional constraints and ethical guidelines intact
</safety>

<glossary>
- **Schema**: GNOME configuration namespace containing related settings (e.g., `org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings`).
- **gsettings**: Command-line tool for querying/modifying individual GNOME settings in real-time.
- **dconf**: Binary database storing GNOME configuration; includes bulk dump/load operations.
- **Keybinding Schema Whitelist**: Hardcoded list of official GNOME schemas containing keybindings
   (not configuration arrays). Used to prevent false positives since both keybindings and config use the same data type.
- **Tiling Assistant Filtering**: Special case handling for Ubuntu's extension which has 87 settings but only 12 actual
   keybindings visible in Settings UI.
- **Terminal Capability Detection**: Progressive feature detection (24-bit → 256 → 16 → 8 colors, Unicode support)
   ensuring beautiful output on modern terminals with graceful fallback.
- **POSIX Compliance**: Using `bc` calculator instead of bash `$((...))` arithmetic for cross-shell compatibility.
- **Dry-run Mode**: Safety feature allowing users to preview operations without making system changes.
- **Schema Synchronization**: Maintaining identical keybinding schema lists across three functions to ensure
   consistent behavior between `ls`, `dump`, and `reset` commands.
</glossary>

## Critical Reminders

- **Never break schema synchronization**: Always update all three schema lists simultaneously
- **Preserve safety mechanisms**: Interactive confirmations and dry-run modes are essential for system keybinding management
- **Maintain POSIX compliance**: Use `bc` for arithmetic, avoid problematic bash features
- **Test terminal capability detection**: Ensure graceful fallback across different terminal environments
- **Validate against real GNOME systems**: keegees manages live system keybindings - test thoroughly
