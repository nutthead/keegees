# ShellCheck configuration for keegees
# Professional GNOME keybinding management tool

# Disable SC2059 (printf format string variables) for this terminal UI application
# Rationale: keegees uses extensive colored printf output with controlled color variables
# (C_PRIMARY, C_RESET, etc.) that contain only ANSI escape sequences, never user input
# or untrusted format specifiers. This is a standard pattern in terminal applications.
# Example: printf "${C_PRIMARY}text${C_RESET}\n" is safe and idiomatic for UI apps.
disable=SC2059

# Enable all other checks to maintain code quality:
# SC2034 (unused variables) - Keep enabled to identify truly unused definitions
# SC2155 (declare and assign) - Keep enabled for proper error handling
# SC2046 (quote command substitution) - Evaluate case-by-case for character repetition idioms
# SC2207 (array assignment) - Keep enabled to prefer mapfile over IFS manipulation
